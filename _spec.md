## Automated Data Model Creation Plan

### 1. Setup and Authentication
1. Install the Appwrite SDK for Python
2. Initialize the Appwrite client with project ID and API key
3. Set up the database service

### 2. Create Database
1. Create a new database for the application

### 3. Create Collections
1. Read the `_dataModel.json` file to get the collection definitions
2. Create collections as defined in the data model

### 4. Define Attributes for Each Collection
1. For each collection, create the necessary attributes as defined in the data model
2. Use appropriate attribute types (string, number, boolean, etc.) as specified
3. Set required fields and default values where applicable

### 5. Create Indexes
1. Add indexes to improve query performance on frequently accessed fields as defined in the data model

### 6. Set Permissions
1. Configure appropriate read and write permissions for each collection based on the data model specifications

### 7. Validation and Error Handling
1. Implement error checking and handling throughout the setup process
2. Validate that all collections, attributes, and indexes are created successfully

### 8. (Optional) Data Seeding
1. Create a function to populate the collections with sample data for testing

### 9. Documentation
1. Generate or update API documentation for the created data model
2. Document any specific configurations or considerations for using the data model

This plan outlines the steps to programmatically create the application's data model using the Appwrite API, based on the structure defined in `_dataModel.json`. Once this high-level plan is approved, we can proceed to write the actual Python code to implement these steps.

Note: Since we're using Appwrite, which provides a document database, the data model will not be relational in the traditional sense. Instead, we'll be working with collections and documents.
