- estimated_calories: Number (Optional) - Estimated calories if available.

## 3. ExerciseItem

Represents an individual exercise activity performed by the user.

### Fields:

- type: String - The type of exercise.

- duration: Number - Duration in minutes.

- intensity: String (Optional) - Intensity level (e.g., "Light," "Moderate," "Intense").

- calories_burned: Number (Optional) - Estimated calories burned.

## 4. CaffeineIntake

Represents the total caffeine consumption and its sources for the day.

### Fields:

- total_caffeine: Number - Total caffeine in mg.

- sources: List<CaffeineSource> - Detailed information on caffeine sources.

## 5. CaffeineSource

Represents an individual source of caffeine consumed by the user.

### Fields:

- name: String - The name of the caffeine source (e.g., "Coffee," "Tea").

- amount: String - The amount consumed (e.g., "1 cup").

- caffeine_content: Number - Caffeine content in mg.

## 6. SweetsIntake

Represents the user's sweets consumption for the day.

### Fields:

- consumed: Boolean - Whether sweets were consumed.

- details: String (Optional) - Additional details on sweets consumed (e.g., type, quantity).



## Automated Data Model Creation Plan

### 1. Setup and Authentication
1. Install the Appwrite SDK for Python
2. Initialize the Appwrite client with project ID and API key
3. Set up the database service

### 2. Create Database
1. Create a new database for the Diet Tracker application

### 3. Create Collections
1. Create the following collections:
   - DailyEntry
   - FoodItem
   - ExerciseItem
   - CaffeineIntake
   - CaffeineSource
   - SweetsIntake

### 4. Define Attributes for Each Collection
1. For each collection, create the necessary attributes as defined in the data model
2. Use appropriate attribute types (string, number, boolean, etc.)
3. Set required fields and default values where applicable

### 5. Create Relationships
1. Set up relationships between collections:
   - DailyEntry to FoodItem (one-to-many)
   - DailyEntry to ExerciseItem (one-to-many)
   - DailyEntry to CaffeineIntake (one-to-one)
   - DailyEntry to SweetsIntake (one-to-one)
   - CaffeineIntake to CaffeineSource (one-to-many)

### 6. Create Indexes
1. Add indexes to improve query performance on frequently accessed fields

### 7. Set Permissions
1. Configure appropriate read and write permissions for each collection

### 8. Validation and Error Handling
1. Implement error checking and handling throughout the setup process
2. Validate that all collections, attributes, and relationships are created successfully

### 9. (Optional) Data Seeding
1. Create a function to populate the collections with sample data for testing

### 10. Documentation
1. Generate or update API documentation for the created data model
2. Document any specific configurations or considerations for using the data model

This plan outlines the steps to programmatically create the Diet Tracker data model using the Appwrite API. Once this high-level plan is approved, we can proceed to write the actual Python code to implement these steps.
